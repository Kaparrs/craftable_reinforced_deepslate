## 📦 About
Reinforced Deepslate is a rare, blast-resistant block that’s naturally unobtainable in survival mode—it can only be found deep within the mysterious Ancient Cities. Mining it takes an incredibly long time, and it drops nothing when broken.

With this datapack, you can now craft it legitimately in survival using the recipe below:
